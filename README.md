# Statistical-Analysis-with-Python-Chi-Square-Test-and-ANOVA
Description:

This repository provides Python scripts for conducting statistical analyses using two fundamental techniques: the chi-square test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). These analyses are essential for understanding relationships between categorical variables and comparing means across multiple groups, respectively.

Approaches:

Chi-Square Test:
The repository includes Python scripts implementing the chi-square test, a statistical method for determining whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. The approach encompasses:
Formulation of hypotheses to test for independence between variables.
Calculation of expected frequencies under the assumption of independence.
Computation of the chi-square statistic to measure the discrepancy between observed and expected frequencies.
Determination of degrees of freedom and critical values for hypothesis testing.
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):
Additionally, the repository contains Python scripts for conducting ANOVA, a technique used to compare means across multiple groups. The approach includes:
Formulation of hypotheses to test for differences in group means.
Decomposition of total variance into between-group and within-group components.
Calculation of sums of squares, degrees of freedom, and mean squares for hypothesis testing.
Determination of the F-statistic and comparison with critical values for hypothesis testing.
Usage:

Users can utilize the provided Python scripts to perform chi-square tests and ANOVA analyses on their own datasets.
Each script is accompanied by detailed documentation and explanations of the analysis steps, making it accessible to users of varying levels of expertise.
By leveraging the code in this repository, users can gain insights into the relationships between categorical variables and the differences in means among multiple groups within their datasets.
Conclusion:

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for conducting statistical analyses in Python, focusing specifically on the chi-square test and ANOVA. With clear documentation and detailed explanations, users can confidently apply these techniques to analyze categorical and continuous data and draw meaningful conclusions from their datasets. Whether for research, data analysis, or academic purposes, this repository equips users with the tools necessary for robust statistical analysis.
